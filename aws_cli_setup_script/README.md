# LocalStack + AWS CLI Setup for Local S3 Development


This guide explains how to run LocalStack using Docker and configure the AWS CLI to work with a simulated local AWS environment. It also includes an automated script to simplify environment setup.


---


## 1. Running LocalStack with Docker


Run the following command to start LocalStack, which emulates AWS services locally (such as S3):


```bash
docker run -it -p 4566:4566 -p 4571:4571 localstack/localstack
````

| Command part            | Meaning                                            |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `docker run`            | Runs a Docker container                            |
| `-it`                   | Interactive terminal mode                          |
| `-p 4566:4566`          | Maps port 4566 (used by S3 and other services)     |
| `-p 4571:4571`          | Maps port 4571 (used by other LocalStack services) |
| `localstack/localstack` | Official LocalStack Docker image                   |

<summary> üõë How to Stop and Restart LocalStack </summary>

### üßØ Stopping LocalStack

1. First, find the running container:

```bash
docker ps
```

Look for the name or container ID of the LocalStack container (e.g., localstack/localstack, or something like sleepy_darwin).

Then stop it by name or container ID:

```bash
docker stop <container_id_or_name>
```
Example:

```bash
docker stop localstack-persistent
```

> üí° *Note*: Avoid using `--rm` when starting LocalStack, or all buckets and resources will be deleted when the container stops.

üîÑ Restarting LocalStack (with persistence)
To reuse a container and keep your previous resources, start it like this with a name:

```bash
docker run -it --name localstack-persistent -p 4566:4566 localstack/localstack
```
This allows you to stop and start it later without losing data:

```bash
docker stop localstack-persistent
docker start -a localstack-persistent
```
-a brings it to the foreground again so you can see logs.

<summary> üîΩ How to Check if LocalStack is Running </summary>


### 1. Using `nc` (netcat)
Check if port 4566 is open:


```bash
nc -zv localhost 4566
```


‚úÖ Success: LocalStack is running  
‚ùå Failure: It's not running


---


### 2. Using `curl`
Check the health endpoint:


```bash
curl http://localhost:4566/health
```


You‚Äôll get a JSON with running services.


---


### 3. Using Docker or Podman
Check running containers:


```bash
docker ps | grep localstack
# or
podman ps | grep localstack
```


Shows container name, status, and port mapping.

## 2. Configuring AWS CLI to Use LocalStack


Open a new WSL terminal and run:


```bash
aws --version
aws configure
```


When prompted, enter:


```
AWS Access Key ID [None]: test
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: test
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```


To verify the connection, run:


```bash
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 s3 ls
```


If no error occurs, you are connected to your simulated LocalStack AWS environment.


---


## 3. Automated Setup Script


To make it easier to verify that LocalStack is running and to automatically configure AWS CLI, we created a script called `lab-setup.sh`:


### Create the script


Navigate to your project folder and create the script file:


```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/Priscilla Clark/AWS_projects/aws_cli_setup_script/src"
touch lab-setup.sh
nano lab-setup.sh
```


### Script contents


```bash
#!/bin/bash


echo "üîç Checking if LocalStack is running..."


if nc -z localhost 4566; then
    echo "‚úÖ LocalStack is active on port 4566"
else
    echo "‚ùå LocalStack doesn't appear to be running. Please open another terminal and run:"
    echo "   docker run -it -p 4566:4566 docker.io/localstack/localstack"
    exit 1
fi


echo "‚öôÔ∏è Configuring AWS CLI to use LocalStack..."


aws configure set aws_access_key_id test
aws configure set aws_secret_access_key test
aws configure set region us-east-1
aws configure set output json


echo "‚úÖ AWS CLI configured for LocalStack"


# Quick test
echo "üì¶ Testing access to local S3:"
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 s3 ls
```


Save and exit (`Ctrl + O`, Enter, `Ctrl + X`).


### Make the script executable


```bash
chmod +x lab-setup.sh
```


### Using the script


Each time you open a new WSL terminal, run:


```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/Priscilla Clark/AWS_projects/aws_cli_setup_script/src"
./lab-setup.sh
```


This will:


* Verify that LocalStack is running on port 4566
* Configure AWS CLI with fake credentials and region for LocalStack
* Test the connection to local S3
